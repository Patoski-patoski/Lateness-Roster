# Lateness-Roster

<h2 style = text-align:'center'>LATENESS APP</h2> 
<p>I want to create an app that records and counts the employers at work for the day.</p>   <h2>KEY FEATURES</h2>  
<ol>It must contain a field where someone can insert their name.</ol> <ol> It must include an area where the time of attendance is automatically filled-in.</ol> <ol>  It gives 30 seconds per employer to write the name (so that one may not write for a friend).</ol>  <ol> It resets after 24 hours.</ol> 

<p>I am mostly likely to add new features at some point in time</p>
